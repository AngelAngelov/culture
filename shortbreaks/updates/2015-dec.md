## Shortbreaks Web Update, December 2015

### Advanced analytics
Sam and Emily have been adding [enhanced ecommerce](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce) tracking to ATG, going forward we should have a better understanding of how customers interact with our products to help make UI decisions easier. It allows us to analyse what the customers have seen including where the product was positioned on the page. We can then see what has been added to the basket and purchased in far more detail than we ever could with event tracking. It should provide us with more insight into customer's journies through the website.

### VPC move
Marc and Rojo have been working closely with IT to move all infrastructure to our [VPC](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11961353/should-i-use-amazons-aws-virtual-private-cloud-vpc).  Currently a lot of our services are exposed on the internet, this move gives us much greater control of what is and isn't available to the average internetter and gives us an incredible amount of extra security, flexibility and agility when dealing with things like ddos attacks.  VPC is now the default account setting for any new AWS accounts such is it's value.  For more info you can join the #vpc_move Slack channel.  This will be happening now in early 2016.

### Opera rate plan codes and commissions
As part of the additional rooms we're making available for Alton Towers, Rojo has reorganised the opera rate plan code implementation in Revolver. It has grown fairly organically since we started to manage what rates we do and don't expose to our customers from Opera. We've now centralized the default rates and the custom (ticket bucket based) overrides into a single config file and rearranged how we request availability from Opera so it's a lot more watertight now.

### "Flow" javascript pattern
Phil has been working on a javascript pattern for creating easy to read, decoupled, promise based unit testable code, something we don't have in large parts of our systems. It's taken a few iterations but we're starting to get some good unit test coverage in places like The Works controllers and Revolver where traditionally we haven't been able to achieve that.  This pattern is also going to drive code reuse and really push us to think smarter about how we construct and organise our code.  Here's a couple of examples:
https://github.com/holidayextras/the-works/blob/staging/flows/firm.js
https://github.com/holidayextras/revolver/blob/useRequest/libs/utils/requestConnector.js

We'll be running a few "show and tells" in the new year so we can start to migrate code and get our test coverage up and eventually remove “runners”!

### Transformer proliferation
We've got a lot of config in Revolver that can't currently sit in Transformer due to the way it (Revolver) has been architected and this is costing our business many man hours throughout the season.  That's all about to change with https://hxshortbreaks.atlassian.net/browse/FEA-759.  Marc's been understanding what are the highest priority configs (things we make the most changes too) and what in the codebase we need to change to allow Transformer to take control of them.  The main problem is the synchronous nature of Revolvers' engine, once we get that changed things become a lot more straightforward and we can move a lot of the config changes to Cloudant.  These will only be editable by the web team through the Cloudant interface until we come up with a GUI.
