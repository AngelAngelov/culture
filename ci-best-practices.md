### CI should...

- Be "as a service".
- Push 1 or more check to PR's in Github.
- Build on clean environments.
- Build feature branch `pushes` against any upstream changes in deployable branches (staging/master).
- Always use the "best practice project setup" `make` targets.
- Notify "some channels" (Slack, email tbc) of a success or failure of a build.
- Always keep built production artifacts in S3 for a minimum of X days.
- Automatically deploy non feature branches (staging/master) when building.
- Always have access to any off box resources it needs (e.g. AWS CLI).
- Be able to run containered tests (tests must be fixtured).
- Not allow sensitive information in scripts/configuration files.
- Be able to run any build on any "agent/minion".
- Allow us to pay for more concurrency.
- Be able to cancel and rerun builds.
- Give confidence that the code is shippable.
- Allow stats to be gathered programmatically around our KPI's.

### Potential make targets

`make` // project setup, gathering/installing resources

`make test` // runs tests/lint/hint prescribed by the repo (Selenium, unit tests, integration tests etc)

`make deploy` // runs contextually any scripts/tasks associated with pushing code to infrastructure

#### Single step CI

`make ci` (alias, may run all 3) // used by CI to bootsrap the entire deploy process

#### Multiple step CI

It is often advantageous to split up a CI's tasks into multiple steps for speed or clarity, as these will often run in parallel.

Make targets should be prefixed with `ci_` then use a descriptive name for the specific task, examples of this would be:

`make ci_lint`
`make cl_selenium`

These tasks will include `make` in order to bring the box into a state where a specific task can be run.
