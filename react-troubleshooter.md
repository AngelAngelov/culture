## Testing


### The Dom
When testing React components, there are times where you will need to [render into the document](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#renderintodocument) however there is a very clear warning in the documenation that states you will need global `window`, `window.document` & `window.document.createElement`.

Luckily, there is [react-tests-globals-setup](https://github.com/holidayextras/react-tests-globals-setup) which solves this problem & is available on npm (`npm install react-tests-globals-setup --save-dev`).

### Shallow renderer
Sometimes we don't really need to test on the DOM so we can simply use the [shallow renderer](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) which is great for simple tests like:
```javascript
var renderOutput = shallowRender(<MyComponent />)
expect(result.type).toBe('div');
```

### Internal react lifecycle method calls
[React lifecycle methods](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#lifecycle-methods)

It isn't possible to test the internal methods on a react component as they are meant to remain as internal only calls (like a private methods in a classical programming example) and we don't really want to be testing ReactJS itself anyway!

What we *do* want to be testing however is that whatever we expect to have happened within these calls, has happened.

Rather than plagiarize a blog post... here's a good link that explains how to deal with this issue: [http://jaketrent.com/post/test-react-componentwillreceiveprops/](http://jaketrent.com/post/test-react-componentwillreceiveprops/)


### Undefined / unexpected count of children
If you are testing for a specific number of children on `this.props.children` you must be aware that children that are not defined will be part of the count:
```javascript
var Parent = React.createClass({
	render: function() {

		var optionalListItemOne, optionalListItemTwo, optionalListItemthree;
		// Some logic here that sets the list items or leaves them as undefined

		return (
			<ul>
				{optionalListItemOne}
				{optionalListItemTwo}
				{optionalListItemThree}
			</ul>
		);
	}
});
```
Will return a count of `3`.


## State

The consensus (at Holiday Extras) is to ensure state is handled at the highest possible component in the heirarchy. For this reason, unless there's a good use case, *no components should have state*
