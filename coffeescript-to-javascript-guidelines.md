# CoffeeScript to JavaScript Guidelines

## Steps
1. Rename your file extension from `foo.coffee` to `foo.js`
2. Open http://js2.coffee/ & paste the entire contents `foo.js` into the CoffeeScript side
3. Paste the entire contents of the output back into your `foo.js`
4. Rebuild the app, functionality should be unchanged & there should be no JS errors in the console
5. Refactor the “CoffeeScript magic”, using [examples below](#refactoring-coffeescript-magic)
6. If this conversion is being done at the same time as a feature, submit a PR using the [interstitial PR process](#interstitial-pr-process)

## Refactoring CoffeeScript magic

_**Disclaimer**: This file is not a JavaScript style guide. Reference the following files for coding style & principles:_
* [General Javascript Best Practices](/general-javascript-best-practices.md)
* [Clientside Javascript (Backbone) Best Practices](/clientside-javascript-best-practices.md)
* [Coding Principles](/coding-principles.md)

### Classes & super
#### CoffeeScript

```coffee
class CoreProduct extends Product

  initialize: ->
    super
```

#### Generated JavaScript
This is what would be output from js2coffee

```javascript
var CoreProduct,
  extend = function(child, parent) { for (var key in parent) { if (hasProp.call(parent, key)) child[key] = parent[key]; } function ctor() { this.constructor = child; } ctor.prototype = parent.prototype; child.prototype = new ctor(); child.__super__ = parent.prototype; return child; },
  hasProp = {}.hasOwnProperty;

CoreProduct = (function(superClass) {
  extend(CoreProduct, superClass);

  function CoreProduct() {
    return CoreProduct.__super__.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
  }

  CoreProduct.prototype.initialize = function() {
    return CoreProduct.__super__.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
  };

  return CoreProduct;

})(Product);

// ---
// generated by coffee-script 1.9.2
```

#### Refactored JavaScript
We can change from CoffeeScript's classes to Backbone's classes, like so

```javascript
var CoreProduct = Product.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    // we also change from using from `CoreProduct.__super__` to `Product.prototype`
    return Product.prototype.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
  }
});
```

### Variables
#### CoffeeScript

```coffee
_ = require('underscore')
Product = require('models/product')
TerminalMixins = require('presenters/mixins/terminal')
```

#### Generated JavaScript
This is what would be output from js2coffee

```javascript
var Product, TerminalMixins, _;

_ = require('underscore');

Product = require('models/product');

TerminalMixins = require('presenters/mixins/terminal');

// ---
// generated by coffee-script 1.9.2
```

#### Refactored JavaScript
We would move the variable declarations to the same line that they are initialised, like so

```javascript
var _ = require('underscore');
var Product = require('models/product');
var TerminalMixins = require('presenters/mixins/terminal');
```

### Existence checks
#### CoffeeScript

```coffee
_hasFlightCode: ->
  @get('flights')?.out?.flight?.code
```

#### Generated JavaScript
This is what would be output from js2coffee

```javascript
_hasFlightCode: function() {
  var ref, ref1, ref2;
  return (ref = this.get('flights')) != null ? (ref1 = ref.out) != null ? (ref2 = ref1.flight) != null ? ref2.code : void 0 : void 0 : void 0;
}

// ---
// generated by coffee-script 1.9.2
```

#### Refactored JavaScript
This is fairly unreadable, we would remove the temporary `ref` variables and do the following.

```javascript
_hasFlightCode: function() {
  var flights = this.get('flights');
  if(!flights || !flights.out || !flights.out.flight || !flights.out.flight.code)) {
    return;
  }
  return flights.out.flight.code;
}
```

_**Note**: this particular example is excessively complicated. Ideally, if we're having to check a property that's nested this deeply then the checks should be pushed further upstream, such as a flight model in this case._

## Interstitial PR process
The process for converting CoffeeScript to JavaScript at the same time as writing features

1. Create a new “interstitial” branch, based on the project’s master branch
2. Create a “code conversion” branch, based on the “interstitial” branch
3. Create a “feature” branch, based on the “code conversion branch”
4. Both “code conversion” and “feature” can then be merged into “interstitial”, removing the need for two pull requests to be tested
