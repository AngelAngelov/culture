# CoffeeScript to JavaScript Guidelines

## Steps
1. Rename your file extension from `foo.coffee` to `foo.js`
1. Open http://js2.coffee/ & paste the entire contents `foo.js` into the CoffeeScript side
1. Paste the entire contents of the output back into your `foo.js`
1. Rebuild the app, functionality should be unchanged & there should be no JS errors in the console
1. If necessary, convert AMD (requirejs) style modules to Browserify (commonjs) style, as [described below](#converting-from-amd).
1. Refactor the “CoffeeScript magic”, using [examples below](#refactoring-coffeescript-magic)
1. If this conversion is being done at the same time as a feature, submit a PR using the [interstitial PR process](#interstitial-pr-process)

## Converting from AMD

An AMD style module looks like this:

```javascript
define(function(require, exports, module) {
  var foo = require('foo');

  var MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend(_.extend({
    /* ... */
  }, foo);

  return MyModel;
});
```

To convert to commonjs style, remove the surrounding `define` and assign the export to module.exports instead of returning it. It should end up looking about the same as modules in serverside projects.

Be aware that some of our AMD style modules are currently getting away with using certain dependencies (like jquery or underscore) without requiring them. **This will not work** once the modules are converted, so require statements may need to be added in.

```javascript
var _ = require('underscore');
var foo = require('foo');

var MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend(_.extend({
  /* ... */
}, foo);

module.exports = MyModel;
```

Once everything is commonjs style, we can remove more magic from our build process so it's closer to using vanilla browserify.

### Classes & super
#### CoffeeScript

```coffee
class CoreProduct extends Product

  initialize: ->
    super
```

#### Generated JavaScript
This is what would be output from js2coffee

```javascript
var CoreProduct,
  extend = function(child, parent) { for (var key in parent) { if (hasProp.call(parent, key)) child[key] = parent[key]; } function ctor() { this.constructor = child; } ctor.prototype = parent.prototype; child.prototype = new ctor(); child.__super__ = parent.prototype; return child; },
  hasProp = {}.hasOwnProperty;

CoreProduct = (function(superClass) {
  extend(CoreProduct, superClass);

  function CoreProduct() {
    return CoreProduct.__super__.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
  }

  CoreProduct.prototype.initialize = function() {
    return CoreProduct.__super__.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
  };

  return CoreProduct;

})(Product);

// ---
// generated by coffee-script 1.9.2
```

#### Refactored JavaScript
We can change from CoffeeScript's classes to Backbone's classes, like so

```javascript
var CoreProduct = Product.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    // we also change from using from `CoreProduct.__super__` to `Product.prototype`
    return Product.prototype.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
  }
});
```

### Variables
#### CoffeeScript

```coffee
_ = require('underscore')
Product = require('models/product')
TerminalMixins = require('presenters/mixins/terminal')
```

#### Generated JavaScript
This is what would be output from js2coffee

```javascript
var Product, TerminalMixins, _;

_ = require('underscore');

Product = require('models/product');

TerminalMixins = require('presenters/mixins/terminal');

// ---
// generated by coffee-script 1.9.2
```

#### Refactored JavaScript
We would move the variable declarations to the same line that they are initialised, like so

```javascript
var _ = require('underscore');
var Product = require('models/product');
var TerminalMixins = require('presenters/mixins/terminal');
```

### Existence checks
#### CoffeeScript

```coffee
_hasFlightCode: ->
  @get('flights')?.out?.flight?.code
```

#### Generated JavaScript
This is what would be output from js2coffee

```javascript
_hasFlightCode: function() {
  var ref, ref1, ref2;
  return (ref = this.get('flights')) != null ? (ref1 = ref.out) != null ? (ref2 = ref1.flight) != null ? ref2.code : void 0 : void 0 : void 0;
}

// ---
// generated by coffee-script 1.9.2
```

#### Refactored JavaScript
This is fairly unreadable, we would remove the temporary `ref` variables and do the following.

```javascript
_hasFlightCode: function() {
  var flights = this.get('flights');
  if(!flights || !flights.out || !flights.out.flight || !flights.out.flight.code)) {
    return;
  }
  return flights.out.flight.code;
}
```

_**Note**: this particular example is excessively complicated. Ideally, if we're having to check a property that's nested this deeply then the checks should be pushed further upstream, such as a flight model in this case._

### Forcing context

#### CoffeeScript
```coffee
parent: ->
  @someMethod (err, result) =>
    @foo() # Executed in context of parent
```


#### Generated JavaScript
This is what would be output after the conversion:

```javascript
parent: function() {
  return this.someMethod((function(_this) {
    return function(err, result) {
      return _this.foo(); // Executed in context of parent
    };
  })(this));
}
```


#### Desirable JavaScript
```javascript
parent: function() {
  var self = this;
  this.someMethod(function(err, result) {
      self.foo(); // Executed in context of parent
  });
}
```




### Return values
#### CoffeeScript

```coffee
func = ->
  doSomething()
```

#### Generated JavaScript
This is what would be output after the conversion:

```javascript
var func;

func = function() {
  return doSomething();
};
```

#### Refactoring process
With coffeescript the last statement of a function is always returned even if not required.

The first thing to do here is to check how this function is called. It could be called from many places so it's best to perform a search of the code base for the method name.

If the callers expect a return value from the function please keep the `return` keyword, if not please remove it to avoid confusion.


### Static methods
#### CoffeeScript
There are occasions when you will come across static methods or properties that are attached directly to the class itself.

```coffee
class Foo extends Bar
  @staticBaz = ->
    ...
```

#### Generated JavaScript
This is what would be output after the conversion:

```javascript
Foo = (function(superClass) {
  ...
  Foo.staticBaz = function() {};
  ...
})(Bar);

// ---
// generated by coffee-script 1.9.2
};
```

#### Desirable JavaScript
We can use the optional `classProperties` parameter in [Backbone's extend function](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-extend) to achieve the same thing.

```javascript
var Foo = Bar.extend({
  ...
}, {
  staticBaz: function() {
  ...
});
```


### Comments

Please check all comments in the source coffeescript as converters such as http://js2.coffee/ will not convert comments and they will be removed in the Javascript output.

Tripapp does not have many comments but those that are there normally indicate particular problem areas or complex logic which may reference JIRAs etc.

If the comment is still relevant after the conversion please make sure the comment is kept on the appropriate place.

## Interstitial PR process
The process for converting CoffeeScript to JavaScript at the same time as writing features

1. Create a new “interstitial” branch, based on the project’s master branch
2. Create a “code conversion” branch, based on the “interstitial” branch
3. Create a “feature” branch, based on the “code conversion branch”
4. Both “code conversion” and “feature” can then be merged into “interstitial”, removing the need for two pull requests to be tested
