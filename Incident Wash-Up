Incident Wash-Ups should be used to discuss issues that have affected our customers and how we can help to avoid similar situations from occurring in the future. The Wash-Up should include all relevant parties at their earliest opportunity after the event. 

Please use this format for all Incident Wash-Ups so that we have a consistent set of data on how we handle situations. Please add all notes from Incident Wash-Ups to the Confluence space (https://holidayextras.jira.com/wiki/display/WEB/Incident+Wash-Ups), for reference.
