# Technical Planning Meetings

## Definition

* A technical planning meeting is an informal discussion aimed at streamlining our development processes and agreeing a technical solution.
* They can be as short or as long as necessary.
* They should be requested by engineers.

## When is one appropriate?

* When starting a new project
* When adding new features or functionality
* When the technical implementation is not clear for a feature iteration
* When undertaking work that requires multiple teams to collaborate

## Expected Outcomes

* High level documentation of the business problem, the technical solution and/ or next steps and the business value (it is clear the complexity of the task in order that a PL can establish the business benefits)
* Engineers should have a clear understanding of what is expected
* What the next steps are, this could be a set of Jiras for Pod Leads to prioritise 
* A definition of done/ acceptance criteria
* Pod Leads or Stakeholders should be clear what Tech Debt there is with any MVP (Minimum Viable Product)


## Probable Attendees

* Engineer(s) with a technical challenge
* Engineer(s) to support the disucssion and agree a technical solution/ next steps
* Database gurus (if database work will be required)
* UXUI gurus (if frontend work will be required)
* Business owners (if the business requirements are sufficiently complex and to assess the business value)
* Testers (if there is a large testing requirement)
* Project gurus (if Engineers might require additional technical assistance)

## The Process

1. Make a copy of the [TPM template](https://docs.google.com/a/holidayextras.com/document/d/1zVbOz0dRAnzZ6UhjYO1Ce1YGI2dzvEoYvZfkTK7qjYU/edit?usp=sharing). Part 1 is completed and notification of the TPM is posted with a link to the document in the Slack Channel #tpm
2. At the TPM, the engineer explains the business problem they're trying to solve and open it up for discussion (if there is no technical proposal, otherwise:).
3. The developers explain their technical solution and open it up for discussion.
4. We exchange thoughts and ideas, fill in any blanks and compromise where necessary to reach a good solution - using the template agenda as a meeting guide.
5. We break the work down into small chunks.
6. If the chunks of work are not small enough to begin work, arrange for future technical planning meetings to dig deeper into the problem (an example of when this might be necessary - "We want to start selling Coach")
7. Following the TPM, the engineer discusses the outcome with the Pod Lead and/ or key stakeholders to agree next steps and confirm business value.
8. Pod Leads prioritise the work as appropriate
9. To improve visibility of the TPM, once the TPM template has been completed, circulate a link with the TL;DR to relevant groups (e.g. webit email group).
