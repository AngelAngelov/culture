# Technical Planning Meetings

## What are they?

* A technical planning meeting (TPM) is an informal discussion aimed at validating, refining and/or agreeing the technical solution to a given problem.

## When is one appropriate?

* When starting a new project.
* When adding new features or functionality that are:
  * Technically complex.
  * Highly dependent on platforms/code.
  * Changing or introducing a new fundamental piece.
  * Likely to impact the work of other pods.

## What do you get from it?

* High level documentation of the business problem, the technical solution (or next steps to finding it) and the expected impact on platforms and pods.
* Implementers should have a clear understanding of what is expected moving forward.
* An understanding, shared with Pod Leads or Stakeholders, on what [Tech Debt](https://github.com/holidayextras/culture/blob/master/tech-debt.md) this work might create.


## Who should be there?

* In addition to the person/people presenting the technical challenge, it depends. You'll want to consider inviting:
 * Platform experts in the areas you'll be affecting.
 * Data representation if your solution calls for it.
 * UX/UI experts if you're impacting the user Experience.
 * Experts in the business problem if the business requirements are sufficiently complex.
 * INF representation if you'll have any unique networking or hosting requirements.
 * Multimedia representation where needed.

## How does the process work?

### Part 1 - Before the TPM

* **Important update:** Prepare a solution to the problem. Try not to take an open or unconsidered problem case to the group, using it to refine and validate instead.
* Make a copy of the [TPM template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cnVQXn5NuRiR7zMWDP4qXF9Qeqiwo2_glxFfEX5zjeM/edit) and fill out the top part. Announce the TPM in the Slack Channel #tpm, but make sure you consider and reach out to the people you think need to attend, as above.

### Part 2 - During the TPM

* At the TPM, the host(s) explain the business problem they're trying to solve and open it up for discussion.
* The host(s) explain their technical solution and opens it up for discussion.
* Attendees challenge decisions and help to refine the solution, which is documented in the template copy shared on Slack.

### Part 3 - After the TPM

* Following the TPM, the host(s) discuss the outcome with the Pod Lead and/ or key stakeholders to agree next steps and confirm business impact.
* Once the TPM template has been completed in full it is shared again on the #tpm channel with a TL;DR of the decisions that were made.
