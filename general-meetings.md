# General meetings

This is a guide to meetings held by developers where a discussion is likely to occur, often with differing opinions of tech.

## Have an opinion
* Challenge appropriately
* Ask questions

## Champion others
* Scan the room to see if anybody isn't being given the freedom to speak (hand in the air, trying to talk, being cut off mid-sentence) & help them to be heard

## Bikeshedding
* [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality)
* Don't get lost in the technicalities, keep to the point of the meeting
* Opinion is great, don't confuse it with facts when necessary
* Don't be afraid to bring the meeting back on topic
