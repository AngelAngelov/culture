# Pairing

Pair programming is the process of two or more people sitting at the same machine to solve a technical problem. Outside of programming, pairing can be a used to solve all manner of diverse problems. It is essentially the modern embodiment of the 500 year old proverb that two heads are better than one.

## When should we pair?

Pairing can be used in various scenarios to achieve varying goals. Sometimes the way you pair needs modifying to make sure you're achieving that goal. At HX, we would typically use pairing to onboard new hires, solve difficult problems and spread knowledge. 

The Scrum Alliance describe the pair as a Driver and a Navigator. The Driver would be in control of the keyboard while the Navigator provides instruction. This does slightly over simplify the relationship, so we'll break out some of the different ways we pair depending on the situation.

### Onboarding

During onboarding you would typically pair a new hire with an experienced hire. The intention is for the experienced hire to provide the context and safety net needed for the new hire to learn on a real platform. 

This is the prime example where Driver and Navigator is a incomplete analogy. If the new hire is following instruction and doesn't understand *why* they're performing actions, they're unlikey to be able to complete a similar task independently in the future, which should be a key aim of pairing for onboarding. In pairing for onboarding the Navigator should more resemble a Coach.
