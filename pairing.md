# Pairing

Pair programming is the process of two or more people sitting at the same machine to solve a technical problem. Outside of programming, pairing can be a used to solve all manner of diverse problems. 

## When should we pair?

There's no concrete right or wrong time, but it's worth keeping in mind that the way you pair needs modifying to make sure you're achieving that goal. At HX, we would typically use pairing to onboard new hires, solve difficult problems and spread knowledge. 

The Scrum Alliance describe the pair as a Driver and a Navigator. The Driver would be in control of the keyboard while the Navigator provides instruction. This does slightly over simplify the relationship, so we'll break out some of the different ways we pair depending on the situation.

### Onboarding

During onboarding you would typically pair a new hire with an experienced hire. The intention is for the experienced hire to provide the context and safety net needed for the new hire to learn on a real platform. It has been proven, externally and internally, to be a really effective, supportive way of getting a new hire up to speed.

This is the prime example where Driver and Navigator is a incomplete analogy. If the new hire is following instruction and doesn't understand *why* they're performing actions, they're unlikey to be able to complete a similar task independently in the future, which should be a key aim of pairing for onboarding. In pairing for onboarding the Navigator should more resemble a Coach.

An effective onboarding pair will typically have the new hire at the keyboard with the experienced person providing a mix of instruction and questioning. It's this questioning, and opportunity for the new hire to question their own understanding, that helps the new hire to build the context around the instruction. There is some [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning#Revans.27_formula) that supports this style of learning.

### Problem solving

Pairing to problem solve is essentially the modern embodiment of the 500 year old proverb that two heads are better than one. In pairing you're combining your collective experience and cognitive capacity to try and increase the likelihood and/or speed of solving a problem.

To use the Scrum Alliance analogy, the Driver and the Navigator will likely be switching throughout the process. It won't however be as effective if the Driver is simply exercising the will of the Navigator, as they won't be contributing their portion of experience of cognitive capacity, so it's important that while one person may be typing, both are contributing to the thought process.

There should still be an open, questioning dialogue between the pair. Thinking out loud will help the pair to combine their understanding of the problem and the proposed solution. 

### Knowledge sharing

The more critical a part of a system, the more we need to ensure we have the right solution, it's well built and we have resilience in our support of it. We would not want to find critical part of a system the be built using an unchecked strategy, in a confusing way, by one person who is on holiday. Especially on the day it's broken. So, we should identify these parts and use pairing as a way to mitigate against this risk.

The approach to this pairing will be very similar to when pairing to problem solve. What we may find is that the solution is simple, but this mustn't stop us from pairing. The value is in knowing why the solution has been built that way and how it works.

## The costs of pairing

There is a great paper on the costs and benefits of pair programming here: http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF

The study was pairing two experienced programmers. In short, the investigation found that the time take to complete a task was not doubled by working in a pair, with an average of only 15% increase in combined time spent. 

The benefits included 15% fewer defects, significantly less (more concise) code and a more enjoyable experience for the pair. The long term benefit of knowledge share and better decision making are harder to prove, but for a 15% cost, the benefits are clear and worthwhile.

### What to do next

- Give it a go and consider what you're trying to achieve through pairing.
- At the end of the session, reflect as a pair and give each other feedback.
- See you if you can be observed by a 3rd party (e.g. a Dev Lead) to get some external feedback.
