# Dependencies

During our recent work to reduce the footprint of our client-side JavaScript we have come across a reoccurring issue that causes our JavaScript bundle to keep increasing in size.

Many of our applications have both internal and external code dependencies and these internal dependencies usually contain a set of their own dependencies. What we are finding is that when there are shared dependencies between the parent project and the child, there are occasions when dependencies are updated in one project and not another.

## Example

A perfect example of this is Lodash. Lodash is used in many of our projects and if versions are not kept in sync then you can see something like this:

When versions are matched:

![Small footprint](/images/dependencies/small.png)

After upgrading the Lodash version within our client application but not it's dependencies:

![Larger footprint](/images/dependencies/large.png)

The total bundle size has increased by 6.3%

When we go to generate the minified JavaScript asset and it finds a version mismatch, it will usually bundle both versions of the package into the released asset, which will impact the size and performance of our applications.

With this in mind, when upgrading/downgrading dependencies in any way then it would be beneficial to check that any applications that are dependent on these libraries have their versions kept in sync.
