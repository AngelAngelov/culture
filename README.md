## Contributing

Anyone associated with Holiday Extras, including our customers and partners, should feel free to create a branch or fork and submit a pull request with additions, updates or deletions. That being said, we do expect anyone contributing to our culture to watch out for a few things.

* Edits should attempt to avoid [fallacies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) and [cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) when making their cases for inclusion of contributions. We prefer to follow objective data and arguments.
* We use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax to format these documents.
