# Mob Testing


The Mob Testing Method can be used with any amount of testers and wouldnâ€™t always require a large group. As long as
those involved are working on the same piece of work and are collectively raising any issues/advisories together. 

Mob Testing is most useful when a large or new piece of code is going to be deployed to production and could
potentially have a big impact. It is most effective when there is a group of 2 or more all looking at the same work
and sharing Browsers and Devices between them. It is a quicker process in findings bugs and more of an exploratory
approach is taken. 

If you need to arrange a Mob Testing session please consider the above points beforehand.

## Key features of Mob Testing:

* Only requires a minimum of 2 people 
* Useful for when large pieces of code are being deployed to production
* Quicker process of finding bugs 
* Not very time consuming
