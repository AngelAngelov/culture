#Raising Jiras

<p>Jiras are used at Holiday Extras as a means for teams to communicate what work is required (including data and insights). This doc seeks to outline some general guidelines and best practice when writing a jira.</p>

##Title:
<p>This is a brief description of the problem to be solved. Be clear and to the point.</p>

**Good example:**
<p>"Change the endpoints in HAPI to new Horizon service for Flexible Car Hire"</p>

**Bad example:**
<p>"Barbados car hire GM"</p>

##Description:
<p>This will vary depending on the type of ticket being raised. Below are some templates that can be used for different types of work (recognising that there isn't a one size fits all). The aim with using templates is to help collate all the information up front, so meeting the standards of the Definition of Ready, and to ensure consistency in approach across the business.</p>

- Developers
- Insights
- Testing
- Requests from the business
<p>*(Will add in links to headings on 2nd iteration)*</p>

###Developers

**1. Requirements**
<p>This is the 'what', outlining the details of the work required or the problem to be solved. Some key things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which system does this relate to? (Work across multiple systems to solve the same problem can (should?) be split into separate tickets.</li>
</ul>

**2. Reason/goal**
<p>This is the 'why'. Relate this to the customer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's in it for them?</li>
<li>What is the main benefit that will be realised by carrying out this work?</li>
</ul>

**3. Automated testing**
<p>This section must be completed by the Dev team prior to starting work on the ticket.</p>
*To be completed further - welcome to input here*

**4. Manual testing**
<p>This section must be completed by the Dev team prior to starting work on the ticket.</p>
*To be completed further - welcome to input here*

**5. Measure of success**
<ul>
<li>How will we know that we have fulfilled our goal?</li>
<li>What is the key metric that we are using to determine if this work has had the desired outcome?</li>
</ul>

**6. Acceptance criteria**
<ul>
<li>How we will know when the work is complete - at what point do we consider it 'done'?</li>
</ul>


###Insights
*To be completed shortly - CW meeting with Insights 3/2 to determine requirements*


###Testing
[Many templates have been developed already](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OUKV6cR4n9yqGWo8jyKdAQ6AD-8hPGxNGpH-3cFf8fM/edit)
<p><em>Can we consolidate and simplify these as there seems to be some duplication?</em></p>


###Requests from the business
*To be completed - have we got examples of good/bad practice here?*


##Epic Link
By linking Jiras to the relevant epic this enables us to review all the work involved in developing a feature or product. 
*(Benefits to be added in here)*


##Attachments
Not all jiras will require attachments; some examples where they are useful:
<ul>
<li>Front end design changes: include mock ups, wireframes</li>
<li>Customer bugs: Recordits and screenshots to illustrate the problem we need to solve</li>
<li>Completed data reports: bespoke queries presented in Excel</li>
</ul>
